# startup
Hello Everyone! I am a designer/engineer with 2 years of experience, and I am looking to start a new software company based in Europe.
The big issue I am facing right now is finding talented developers, designers and marketing people from all around the world. 
(I am looking to do this pay free and instead giving you a percentage in the company as business partners. If you want more information 
on the product and the job, please send me an email (gmarkidis08@gmail.com)
